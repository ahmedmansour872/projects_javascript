            AlgoExpert was the backbone of my technical coding interview
            preparation. It allows you to efficiently work through the most
            common variations of problems asked by top-tier companies without
            having to spend hours 'battling' an algorithm only to come up with
            an inefficient or incorrect solution. There are a lot of resources
            available for repetition, but AlgoExpert differentiates its product
            by providing the 'how' and 'why' in clear and concise videos.
            Developing a deeper understanding of how to approach these problems
            is better than trying to memorize lines of code. I highly recommend
            AlgoExpert.

            As a scientist who was looking to break into Tech, I knew the
            underlying logic of programming, but I had a lot of gaps in my
            understanding, especially on the types of algorithms questions asked
            at interviews. I can confidently say that AlgoExpert is one of the
            best resources out there for interview preparation, with fantastic
            video tutorials and an excellent question selection that allows you
            to get a deep understanding of the topics and confidence in your
            problem solving ability. The site is incredibly intuitive to use and
            I think that the staff are some of the best out there, being
            incredibly supportive and passionate about offering a great customer
            experience. I cannot recommend AlgoExpert highly enough.

            I'm just writing to thank you for this product. I had failed in so
            many interviews before, but I wanted to get into a top tech company
            so much that I even enrolled in a Master's program. Even then, I was
            unsure if I had what it takes to make it. From the moment I heard
            your first video explanation, I thought 'this is exactly the way to
            solve an interview question' (plus the extra points you can grab by
            asking clarifying questions). After a few months of studying, mainly
            on AlgoExpert, I got offers to intern at Microsoft and Google!

            I just accepted an offer with Palantir, and also received an offer
            from Amazon and a handful of startups. AlgoExpert does a great job
            selecting problems- many of my interview questions were variants of
            problems on the website. And when I came across problems I hadn't
            seen before, AlgoExpert gave me the tools to select the right data
            structures and identify patterns. Thanks AlgoExpert!

            I just got a job offer from Oracle and most of the questions they
            asked, I had practiced on AlgoExpert. Even when they asked questions
            I was not familiar with, I was able to break down the problem and
            write code which I learned from the explanations section on
            AlgoExpert. Being a Computer Science Engineering student, I had
            fundamental knowledge in Data Structures & Algorithms, but I didn't
            know how to approach, break down and apply this knowledge to solve
            problems. Also since all the problems are classified into
            categories, I was able to easily identify my weak points and work on
            those. Extremely grateful to AlgoExpert !

            to anyone preparing for the job market.

            Hey, just wanted to thank you for AlgoExpert! I signed up a few
            months back and I went through 60% of the problems. Before
            AlgoExpert I was awful at solving anything harder than a LeetCode
            easy, now I can do LeetCode mediums without much effort and tackle
            LeetCode hards in a reasonable time frame! I don’t think I would
            have gotten an internship without AlgoExpert, so thank you!

            According to me landing on a dream job requires strong determination
            and continuous practice. But the most important thing is to find the
            right resource for the practice and I found AlgoExpert. Algoexpert
            provided me a platform to improve my thought process towards an
            algorithm question. It really helped me to shape my thinking skills
            and coding skills. I would definitely recommend to all the aspiring
            software engineers.

            There are thousands of practice problems out there, but AlgoExpert
            provides curation, in-depth explanation, code testing, and support
            for multiple programming languages. A lot of the problems even have
            multiple solutions. I'm very glad I invested in it, and even though
            I've already been hired, I'm still using it to keep my skills up.

            AlgoExpert was the best resource I used during my coding interview
            prep. Its structure, hand-picked questions, and detailed explanation
            videos really set it apart from other resources I tried. It helped
            me go into my interviews with confidence, allowing me to do well not
            only with small startups but also with big tech companies.

            I've tried a few of the algorithm learning resources and I think
            AlgoExpert is the best (and no I'm not being paid for this post).
            The site is super polished and offers a nice breadth of problems to
            get you best prepared with great solutions and video explanations.
            If you're on the job hunt, I think pairing AlgoExpert with an
            interviewing resource like Pramp and/or Interviewing.io is a great
            strategy.

            AlgoExpert helped me be confident in my interviews. Their curated
            list of questions and Clément's thorough review videos ensured that
            I was ready for anything thrown at me in onsite interviews. I highly
            recommend AlgoExpert to anyone looking to secure a tech job, or just
            brush up on their algorithm skills.
